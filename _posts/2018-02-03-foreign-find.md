I found this one while I was on holiday in Hong Kong. With the help of some friends I was able to translate it! It looks like it was details of a house being rented.

This is the message in romanised Chinese:
```
Ting Wang Jiao
Da Jiao Ju Yang Lou Gao Cheng
Liang Fang Yi Ting Zha 12000
Yu Kuai You
6072XXXXXXX
```

And in romanised Cantonese:
```
Ting Mong Kok
Dai Kok Ju Yawn Lao Gou Chen
Liang Fong Yik Ting Zam 12000
6072XXXXXXX
```

And the relevant part translated to English:
```
2 bedroom 1 living room 12000
6072XXXXXXX
```
