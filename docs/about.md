# Why?

I enjoy thinking about the story that ended up with something being left behind:

* Who wrote it?
* Why did they write it?
* Who was it for?
* Why did it get lost?

 Sometimes it's simple like a dentist appointment, but sometimes it's more complex or personal like a diary page or a note to a housemate.

# Identity

* Any information that could lead back to a specific individual (Full names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, etc) is censored before posting to protect their identity.
