The best way to share your thoughts about a specific post is by using the Disqus comments at the bottom of each post. Suggestions, feedback and questions are welcome and best sent by [email](mailto:groundtruths0@gmail.com) or the form below. The about page will be updated with an F.A.Q. section so others can benefit from the answers.

<form action="https://formspree.io/groundtruths0@gmail.com" method="POST" class="form" id="contact-form">
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-xs-6">
      <input type="text" name="name" class="form-control input-lg" placeholder="Name" title="Name" required="required">

It would be great to share theories about the things people have left behind! Help with deciphering tricky handwriting is also always welcome :).

I'm afraid I'm not accepting submissions in case you've seen anything you'd like to add here. I'd encourage you to share it yourself on Twitter or Instagram!

You can find contact links in the footer of every page.
