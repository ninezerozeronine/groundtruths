# Why?

I enjoy thinking about the story that ended up with something handwritten being left behind:

* Who wrote it?
* Why did they write it?
* Who was it for?
* Why did it get lost?

 Sometimes it's simple like a dentist appointment, but sometimes it's more complex or personal like a diary page or a note to a housemate.

# Guidelines

I try to follow a few guidelines whilst I'm looking for ground truths:

* I only record - I try not to interact with anything I see.
* Any information in what I see that could lead back to a specific individual (Full names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, etc) is censored before posting to protect their identity.
