# Why?

I enjoy thinking about the story that culminated in the note being left behind:

* Who wrote it?
* Why did they write it?
* Who was the note for?
* Why did it get lost?

 Sometimes it's simple like a dentist appointment, bot sometimes it's more complex or personal like a diary page or a note to a housemate.

# Guidelines

I try to follow a few guidelines to keep my hobby under control and safe :)

* I only record - I try not to interact with anything I see.
* Any information in what I see that could lead back to a specific individual (Full names, addresses, email addresses, phone numbers, etc) is censored before posting to protect their identity.
